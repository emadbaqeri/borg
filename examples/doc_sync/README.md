# Doc Sync

The following project demonstrates how someone might write a document syncing DApp so that people can share notes in real time with each other.

There are two DApps:

  * fsync - a cmd line interface for syncing files with Box

  * fiewdoc - a web interface that fetches the doc based on a meeting code and renders updates in real time
