# Doc Sync

The following project demonstrates how someone might write a document syncing DApp so that people can share notes in real time with each other.

There are two DApps:

  * fsync - a cmd line interface for syncing files with Box

  * fuludocs - a web interface that fetches the doc based on a meeting code and renders updates in real time

*Warning*
This is for development purposes only.  Anyone with the link to the FuluDocs sample DApp and your PeerId is able to see your notes.
